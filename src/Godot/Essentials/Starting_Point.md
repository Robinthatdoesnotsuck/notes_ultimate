## The three phases to learning programming

There are three phases to learning to code:

1. You will first need to copy code and combine small building blocks for learning.
1. You’ll start to tinker with existing programs as you improve. This is the modification stage.
1. When you’ve done this enough, you’ll be able to create complete things from scratch.

Coding is hard

+ It will take you time to learn to code.
+ It’s normal to get stuck at times, and errors are a good thing.
+ Learning to code is like learning a completely foreign language. At first, you won’t be able to turn all your ideas into code.
+ You will get results along the way, and we will do our best to make your learning experience interesting.
