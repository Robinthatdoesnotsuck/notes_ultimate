# GDScript for like you know Godot?

## What is it?

+ It is an OOP languaje so everything is a class and an object on execution
+ It is based on Python and Ruby, so it is ident sensitive and well goddamn easy on its implementation
  + But just as Ruby it is as dynamic as it is type sensitive, what do I mean by that?
  + That you can have something as a ```var score = 0```
  + Or we can have it like a ```var score : int = 0```

## Data Types

+ Strings
+ Bool
+ Integers
+ Floats/double
+ Arrays
  + They are fin arrays
+ Dictionaries
  + They are just maps like you know maps, but in esteroids been the key/pair anytypeable

### Variables

+ They're scopable so like if you already know programming you know what scope is
+ But also you can like export it for the used and modification on the inspector on the run

### Constants

+ They are constants dude, can't change its value
+ And the coding styles adhere to the standards of FULL CAPS

### MATH operators

+ They are the same syntax as python
+ BUTT ) )
  + You can do the reduced form of most operations (unlike python)

### Logic Operators

+ They are practically the same as python

### Flow control operations

#### IF

+ a common if

#### MATCH

+ They are a pattern matching tool just like Erlang or Rust
+ So it just matches the expression that it might be and like Erlang and Rust you need to especify the any type or the exception to your expected values so you have to keep an eye on that brother and like Erlang the any match it's specified as ```_```

### LOOPS

#### FOR

+ Simple python FOR so it works the same as python

#### WHILE

+ It is a fucking while

### NODE functions, methods and properties

+ Function get_node ```get_node("Character")```
+ the what I call the PHP method ```$Character```
+ The silly billy method of dragging and dropping your node into the code section in the code editor
