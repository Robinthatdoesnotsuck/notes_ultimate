# NodeSystem

+ It's a super dupper tool that helps you in having a good project structure by default
  + This means that without knowing and only doing godot makes you learn good practices by having this tree like project structure of nodes
  + Cause a scene is made of scenes, scenes are made of nodes, nodes are made of nodes and etc.
+ This mades something called the RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM
  + This is a POO term coined by the single responsiblity principle(more on that on the SoftwareEngineering/Design_Patterns section of the notes)
